# Dashboard_test-task

Given the fact that task conditions did`t specify which technologies can be used, during the project implementation I've used the React library and the SASS preprocessor.

My choice is based on these tools because they greatly simplify the development process.

I can also complete this task by using vanilla HTML, CSS & JS.

I've spent 1 day for test task completion.
